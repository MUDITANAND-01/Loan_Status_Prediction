# Loan_Status_Prediction
<br>
-Developed a Loan Status Prediction model using SVM with an accuracy of 0.83 on test data and 0.798 on training data.
<br>
-Utilized Kaggle datasets, preprocessing data to handle missing values and apply label encoding.
<br>
-Analyzed relationships between education, marital status, and loan approval using seaborn count plots.
<br>
-Applied data normalization techniques to improve the model's performance.
<br>
-Split data into training and testing sets with a 90/10 ratio to ensure model robustness.
<br>
-Implemented a system to predict loan approval based on gender, marital status, income, and loan term inputs.
